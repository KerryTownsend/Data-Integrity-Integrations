Sprint discussion with group members:
* Limted exposure to address issues
* Hightlighted that duplicate matching was not always possible as not enough data is available
* Duplciate sources include people completing multipe forms or submitting infor via multiple channels
* Integrating with EventBrite can create duplicates as a booker will make a booking an event for attendees - this results to one contact in Salesforce - workaround ask for individual info and then after event clean up. Make sure Campaign Members list is reprentative of people who attend
* The design of a 'Standard' connector can cause challenges with the way the data is modeled that makes it hard to report appropriately for each organisation
* When using Zapier the Duplicate Alerts need to be turn off as this interupts the data follow
* Zapier, FormAssembly, MailChimp, Shoppify, Integromat (middleware), EventBrite, VirginGiving, JustGiving
* A used example is Zapier to ingrate EventBrite with Salesfroce
* It can be difficult to map data exported from a system together as the reports from some platforms don't include unique IDs
* Add on platforms and connects are often used because they are free but they have limit functions, features that let you design detailed integrations
* this is a new solution that might support improved data integrity https://www.beaufort12.com/eventbrite
* Data chllanges include different spelling and different email addresses
* Solutions include ETL tools
* Product Requests: Would like Salesforce Duplicate rule to be more flexible in weighting, excluded words, different combinations 
* Product Requests: Would like Salesforce to run a job to show want duplicates exist
* Product Request: Would ike Salesforce to have more than one email address that was functional 
* Returning people IDs are coded into url so that the system knows it is the same person even if they enter different info
* Recommendation: Move away from using personal data as identifiers in favour of a unique id so that person can be connected with other records
* Using IDs in urls creates questions about about privacy as the person can be identified by that ID
* Try to avoid using the SF Contact ID. Options include hashing or encrypted IDs
* Different middleware tools have features that allow you to map unique ids to people to create
* Joining peoples interactions together is a challenge that all organisation at the moment
* Signing posting some of the Ingration Design documents
